    /* These are the function prototypes for the Light Controller module production source code
       (LightController.c). Because the Light Scheduler module (which depends on Light Controller module)
       is under test, some of the LightController.c function implementations are overriden with the spy
       implementations in LightControllerSpy.c (this takes place during the linking stage).
       Therefore there's no src/04_LightScheduler/LightController.c file in the project,
       simply because the test code "does not need it" (at least for the time being) */
    
    /* INTERFACES TO BE DEFINED. THEY WILL BE DRIVEN BY THE TEST CODE (THIS IS TDD!) */
